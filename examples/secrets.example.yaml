# Ralph Secrets Example
# Copy this file to either:
#   - ~/.ralph/secrets.yaml (global, applies to all projects)
#   - .ralph/secrets.yaml (project-specific, overrides global)
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit this file to version control!
# Add .ralph/secrets.yaml to your .gitignore

apiKeys:
  # DeepSeek API key (required)
  # Get your key from: https://platform.deepseek.com/
  deepseek: sk-your-deepseek-api-key-here

  # Future providers (not yet implemented)
  # anthropic: sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here
  # openai: sk-your-openai-key-here

# Security best practices:
# 1. Never commit secrets to git
# 2. Set restrictive permissions: chmod 600 ~/.ralph/secrets.yaml
# 3. Use project-specific secrets to override global keys if needed
# 4. Rotate keys regularly
# 5. Use different keys for development and production projects
