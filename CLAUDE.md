# Ralph Go CLI

Port ralph.sh and develop.sh bash scripts to a unified Go CLI tool that orchestrates AI coding agents, manages services, and automates git workflows from branch creation through PR submission - see plan.md for detailed 30-step development roadmap.

## Development Guidelines

- Do not create summary documentation files after completing each step
- Focus on code, tests, and inline documentation
- Keep implementation lean and focused
