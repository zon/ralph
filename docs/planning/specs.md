## Specs

Specs describe your system's behavior using structured requirements and scenarios.

### Structure

The `/specs` directory should be in the repo root. Specs are always organized by component unless the repo contains only one component.

**Single component** — flat structure:

```
/specs
├── auth.md
├── payments.md
└── notifications.md
```

**Multiple components** — grouped by component:

```
/specs
├── api/
│   ├── auth.md
│   └── payments.md
└── frontend/
    ├── auth.md
    └── notifications.md
```

Each spec file lives at `/specs/<component>/<feature>.md`, with one file per feature area.

A **feature** is a coherent slice of user-facing or system-facing behavior — something a user can do, or something the system does on their behalf. Good feature names describe what the system does (`auth`, `payments`, `notifications`), not how it does it (`jwt-handler`, `stripe-client`). If a feature grows too large to read comfortably, split it by sub-feature rather than by implementation detail.

### Spec Format

A spec contains requirements, and each requirement has scenarios:

```markdown
# Auth Specification

## Purpose
Authentication and session management for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement: User Authentication
The system SHALL issue a JWT token upon successful login.

#### Scenario: Valid credentials
- GIVEN a user with valid credentials
- WHEN the user submits login form
- THEN a JWT token is returned
- AND the user is redirected to dashboard

#### Scenario: Invalid credentials
- GIVEN invalid credentials
- WHEN the user submits login form
- THEN an error message is displayed
- AND no token is issued

### Requirement: Session Expiration
The system MUST expire sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity.

#### Scenario: Idle timeout
- GIVEN an authenticated session
- WHEN 30 minutes pass without activity
- THEN the session is invalidated
- AND the user must re-authenticate
```

**Key elements:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `## Purpose` | High-level description of this spec's domain |
| `### Requirement:` | A specific behavior the system must have |
| `#### Scenario:` | A concrete example of the requirement in action |
| SHALL/MUST/SHOULD | RFC 2119 keywords indicating requirement strength |

### Why Structure Specs This Way

**Requirements are the "what"** — they state what the system should do without specifying implementation.

**Scenarios are the "when"** — they provide concrete examples that can be verified. Good scenarios:
- Are testable (you could write an automated test for them)
- Cover both happy path and edge cases
- Use Given/When/Then or similar structured format

**RFC 2119 keywords** (SHALL, MUST, SHOULD, MAY) communicate intent:
- **MUST/SHALL** — absolute requirement
- **SHOULD** — recommended, but exceptions exist
- **MAY** — optional

### What a Spec Is (and Is Not)

A spec is a **behavior contract**, not an implementation plan.

Good spec content:
- Observable behavior users or downstream systems rely on
- Inputs, outputs, and error conditions
- External constraints (security, privacy, reliability, compatibility)
- Scenarios that can be tested or explicitly validated

Avoid in specs:
- Internal class/function names
- Library or framework choices
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Detailed execution plans (those belong in `/designs` or `/projects`)

Quick test:
- If implementation can change without changing externally visible behavior, it likely does not belong in the spec.

### Keep It Lightweight: Progressive Rigor

OpenSpec aims to avoid bureaucracy. Use the lightest level that still makes the change verifiable.

**Lite spec (default):**
- Short behavior-first requirements
- Clear scope and non-goals
- A few concrete acceptance checks

**Full spec (for higher risk):**
- Cross-team or cross-repo changes
- API/contract changes, migrations, security/privacy concerns
- Changes where ambiguity is likely to cause expensive rework

Most changes should stay in Lite mode.

### Human + Agent Collaboration

In many teams, humans explore and agents draft artifacts. The intended loop is:

1. Human provides intent, context, and constraints.
2. Agent converts this into behavior-first requirements and scenarios.
3. Agent keeps implementation detail in `/designs` and `/projects`, not `/specs`.
4. Validation confirms structure and clarity before implementation.

This keeps specs readable for humans and consistent for agents.
