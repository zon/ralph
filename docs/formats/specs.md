# Spec Format

The spec format is used to describe system behavior using structured requirements and scenarios.

## File Location

See [Directory Structure](./README.md#directory-structure) for where spec files are located.

## Structure

A spec contains requirements, and each requirement has scenarios:

```markdown
# Auth Specification

## Purpose
Authentication and session management for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement: User Authentication
The system SHALL issue a JWT token upon successful login.

#### Scenario: Valid credentials
- GIVEN a user with valid credentials
- WHEN the user submits login form
- THEN a JWT token is returned
- AND the user is redirected to dashboard

#### Scenario: Invalid credentials
- GIVEN invalid credentials
- WHEN the user submits login form
- THEN an error message is displayed
- AND no token is issued

### Requirement: Session Expiration
The system MUST expire sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity.

#### Scenario: Idle timeout
- GIVEN an authenticated session
- WHEN 30 minutes pass without activity
- THEN the session is invalidated
- AND the user must re-authenticate
```

**Key elements:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `## Purpose` | High-level description of this spec's domain |
| `### Requirement:` | A specific behavior the system must have |
| `#### Scenario:` | A concrete example of the requirement in action |
| SHALL/MUST/SHOULD | RFC 2119 keywords indicating requirement strength |

## Why Structure Specs This Way

**Requirements are the "what"** — they state what the system should do without specifying implementation.

**Scenarios are the "when"** — they provide concrete examples that can be verified. Good scenarios:
- Are testable (you could write an automated test for them)
- Cover both happy path and edge cases
- Use Given/When/Then or similar structured format

**RFC 2119 keywords** (SHALL, MUST, SHOULD, MAY) communicate intent:
- **MUST/SHALL** — absolute requirement
- **SHOULD** — recommended, but exceptions exist
- **MAY** — optional

## What a Spec Is (and Is Not)

A spec is a **behavior contract**, not an implementation plan.

Good spec content:
- Observable behavior users or downstream systems rely on
- Inputs, outputs, and error conditions
- External constraints (security, privacy, reliability, compatibility)
- Scenarios that can be tested or explicitly validated

Avoid in specs:
- Internal class/function names
- Library or framework choices
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Detailed execution plans (those belong in `/designs` or `/projects`)

Quick test:
- If implementation can change without changing externally visible behavior, it likely does not belong in the spec.

## Keep It Lightweight: Progressive Rigor

We aim to avoid bureaucracy. Use the lightest level that still makes the change verifiable.

**Lite spec (default):**
- Short behavior-first requirements
- Clear scope and non-goals
- A few concrete acceptance checks

**Full spec (for higher risk):**
- Cross-team or cross-repo changes
- API/contract changes, migrations, security/privacy concerns
- Changes where ambiguity is likely to cause expensive rework

Most changes should stay in Lite mode.

## Usage Notes

Specs are typically authored collaboratively:

1. Human provides intent, context, and constraints.
2. Agent converts this into behavior-first requirements and scenarios.
3. Implementation detail belongs in other artifacts, not in specs.
4. Validation confirms structure and clarity before implementation.

This keeps specs readable for humans and consistent for agents.
