name: workflow-env
description: Allow setting environment variables for workflows in ralph config

requirements:
  - category: workflow-env
    description: Workflow env vars configurable in .ralph/config.yaml
    items:
      - The workflow section of .ralph/config.yaml accepts an env map of key-value string pairs
      - Environment variables defined in workflow.env are set in the Argo Workflow when running with --remote
      - Existing workflow configuration (namespace, configMaps, secrets) is unaffected
    passing: false

  - category: workflow-symlinks
    description: configMaps and secrets only create symlinks when explicitly opted in
    items:
      - Each configMap and secret entry in .ralph/config.yaml accepts an optional link boolean property
      - When link is true, a symlink is created in the workspace pointing to the mounted file or directory
      - When link is absent or false, no symlink is created
      - Existing entries without link behave the same as before (no symlink, no error)
    passing: false
